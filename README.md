Requirements
Create web representation of Prototype provided 
Responsives for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile Version via figma 
Use of CSS systems and Framework for responsiveness - Grid, Flexbox and BootStrap

## Please try to fix the following

1. Overflow of the start cooking section
    I think you may want to look into the box method.
    I had similar issues.
2. A lot of the images are broken.
    I cannot see some images for some reason.
    I think the way you routed the path might not be correct
3. Start cooking zoom effect for the hover is not per the figma.
    The images themselves should not be growing.
    They should still have their original dimsensions while zooming in
4. Fall collection card in New Arrivals is incomplete
5. Best Seller cards are growing, similarly to the start cooking. Please fix.
6. padding for the second and third card in Best Seller are inconsistent
7. Responsiveness needs a lot of work.
    Mobile is present, but you may want to adjust it further for tablets too
8. Mobile version needs a lot of work to center sections
9. Lastly I noticed a few of the images that were missing didn't have alt text.
    Please be sure to add alt text where you can.

--Fixed.

## Final thoughts

I think you can probably try spending rest of the day on the items I mentioned above.
Once you fix the image pathing and work slightly more on responsiveness make me aware of the changes.
I will check it out for you again.

I may be missing more because of the few images I cannot see.
